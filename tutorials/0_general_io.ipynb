This allows for standardized and comparable processing independent of the input format, where different unit conventions are common.\n",

    "### Advanced `read()` configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "While ```st.io.read()``` will generally try and configure the parsing routines in a way that should fit most userst, there are several settings that can be adapted:\n",
    "- ```sub_pattern```: This is a path pattern to match files or subdirectory names in the ```path``` location to. Let us assume, we have ```TRAJ_0,TRAJ_1,...TRAJ_99,``` and ```ICOND_0,...ICOND_4``` directories within the same folder, but we only want to load ```ICOND_*``` files. Then we can set ```sub_pattern='ICOND_*'``` and ```read()``` will only consider the matching entries in `path`.\n",
    "- `input_units`: This is an optional setting to determine the units in which different input variables are provided, e.g. `atXYZ` is the variable name for positional data, `forces` is the variable name for forces and `energy` is the variable name for absolute system energy. The units are provided in a `{variable_name:'unit_string'}` fashion, where the variable names can be taken from the declaration of the standard Shnitsel format and the units values for different unit types can be found in `shnitsel.units.definitions`, \n",
    "- `input_state_types` and `input_state_names`: For various formats, it is not entirely possible to derive the multiplicity/type of states and a reasonable readable state name label from the trajectory format. `read()` will make a best effort to apply reasonable state names and state multiplicities based on the input information, but if the resulting state types (or names) are not according to your expectations, you can set them by providing either a list of types or names to the `input_state_types` and `input_state_names` or by providing a function in either of those parameters that takes the already parsed `xarray.Dataset` and can set the `ds.state_types` or `ds.state_names` values based on additional information from the dataset. Note that shnitsel tools will always apply state types first before setting state names and it will use the values of the settings `input_state_types` and `input_state_names` in this order as well, if they are provided.\n",
    "- ```concat_method='db'```: When multiple trajectories are loaded in parallel, they need to be combined into a single result. The default behavior is to pack them into a ShnitselDB structure (based on `xarray.DataTree`) to preserve all meta-data of the individual trajectories, allowing for advanced filtering and storage according to the FAIR principles. \n",
    "Alternatives are \n",
    "- - `'concat'`, which attaches the trajctories along the `time` dimension, which is then referred to as `frame`, effectively building one long, concatenated trajectory. This will lose insights into different meta-data of the concatenated trajectories.\n",
    "- - `'layers'`, which packs all trajectories into a shared `xarray.Dataset` object that has a new `trajid` dimension (meaning: `trajectory id`), along which the different trajectories can be indexed. As in `'concat'`, we will lose individual differences in metadata on the combined object compared to the individual trajectories.\n",
    "- - `'list'`, which simply returnes the trajectories as a list of `xarray.Dataset` objects.\n",
    "- `input_trajectory_id_maps`: This option allows for controlled setting of trajectory ids for individual datasets. If a dict is provided here, the keys are meant to be absolute paths in posix-format (specifically of type `str`) with the associated values being the resulting ids. Alternatively, a function can be provided that receives the `pathlib.Path` object of the input path of the trajectory and is supposed to yield an integer id that is distinct from all other trajectories loaded with the same call to `read()`\n",
    " \n",
    "### More techincal `read()` configuration options\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```multiple=True```: This flag determines whether `read()` should automatically look for entries within the `path` folder to load as input datasets. If set to `False`, only `path` will be attempted to be loaded as a single dataset.\n",
    "- `parallel=True`: A flag that by default allows parallel processing of input in multiple child processes to accelerate multi-trajectory input.\n",
    "- `error_reporting='log'`: A setting to determine whether errors should be thrown as an exception or just logged within the read routine. If parallel reading is enabled, only `log` is supported. \n"
